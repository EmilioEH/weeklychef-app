# WeeklyChef App - Deployment Task List

## 📖 Project Description

**What We’re Building:**
A mobile-friendly meal planning web application called “WeeklyChef” that helps couples plan weekly meals, generate smart grocery lists, and follow step-by-step cooking instructions.

**Key Features:**

- Weekly meal planner with drag-and-drop interface
- Personal recipe library with full CRUD operations
- AI-powered smart grocery list generation (using Gemini API)
- Step-by-step cooking mode with progress tracking
- Ingredient prep mode (mise en place)
- Real-time data synchronization between multiple devices
- Offline-capable with local caching

**Technical Stack:**

- **Frontend:** React (with Hooks), Lucide icons, Tailwind-style utility classes
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore (NoSQL, real-time)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication (email/password)
- **Hosting:** Netlify (static site hosting with CDN)
- **Serverless Functions:** Netlify Functions (to secure API keys)
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API (for grocery list optimization)
- **Version Control:** GitHub (code repository)
- **CI/CD:** Automated deployment from GitHub to Netlify

**User Access Pattern:**
Two users (husband and wife) will share the same account credentials to access synchronized data from separate devices (phones). All recipe modifications, meal plans, and grocery lists will sync in real-time between devices.

**Security Requirements:**

- Gemini API key must be hidden from client-side code
- API calls proxied through Netlify Functions
- Firestore security rules restrict data access to authenticated users only
- No sensitive credentials in GitHub repository

**Deployment Goal:**
Host the application on Netlify with a custom URL, accessible from both phones, with a link embedded in the Shopify store for easy access.
